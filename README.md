# NaNoGenMo2024 entry "Frankenstein's Governess"

This constitutes my entry for [National Novel Generation Month 2024](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2024).

A one-line bash command to generate a 50,000 word "novel" based on a supplied text corpus.

The example text, "Frankenstein's Governess" was generated on November 29, 2024, from a text corpus consisting of [Frankenstein; Or, The Modern Prometheus by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/42324) and [Jane Eyre: An Autobiography by Charlotte Brontë](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1260) as downloaded from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org).

The text was modified as follows:
- The separate text files were concatenated. 
- Extended 8-bit characters (é, æ, etc) replaced by their ASCII equivalents.
- Newlines were replaced by "@"

I shall call it BashGPT, the sheLLM.

Share and enjoy.
